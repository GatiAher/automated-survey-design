        "survey_purpose": "This research is being conducted by researchers at a university. We are inviting you to participate in this research project if you speak one of our target languages. The purpose of this research project is to collect both culturally specific and generally applied social groups, as well as stereotypes about those groups.",
        "procedures": "You will be asked to assign traits to different social groups as they are perceived in your country.For each listed social group, please choose how people in America stereotype the group. Importantly, we are not interested in your personal beliefs, but rather how you think people in America view these groups.Survey should take approximately 10 minutes.",
        "potential_risks_and_discomforts": "There are small risks of emotional discomfort for you in our study since at the one step of our surveys we will ask you which groups you associate yourself with. Our study is targeting marginalized social groups, thus you might experience uncomfortable feelings when answering this question. You are asked to provide demographic information, which introduces a small risk of privacy loss. We mitigate this risk by removing identifying information from your responses immediately upon downloading the data from Mechanical Turk. The questions cannot be skipped and if you do not wish to answer one or more questions, you may opt out of participation without any penalization.",
        "potential_benefits": "There will not be direct benefit to you as a participant. We hope that, in the future, other people might benefit from this study through improved understanding of cross-cultural stereotypes and their presence or absence in computational systems.",
        "confidentiality": "Any potential loss of confidentiality will be minimized by immediately removing crowd worker identifiers as soon as the data is collected. We do not ask for information like name, email address, etc. We will ask for a small amount of demographic information, which will be immediately dis-associated from your crowd working identity. The collected information will be only accessed by researchers working on this project.\n\nIf we write a report or article about this research project, your identity will be protected to the maximum extent possible. Your information may be shared with representatives of the researchers' university or governmental authorities if you or someone else is in danger or if we are required to do so by law.",
        "compensation": "You will receive compensation for this task, directly through the crowdsourcing platform. You will be paid $3.50 for completing this survey. The compensation will be credited immediately, but may be revoked if you do not fully complete this survey. You will be responsible for any taxes assessed on the compensation.",
        "right_to_withdraw_and_questions": "Your participation in this research is completely voluntary.  You may choose not to take part at all. If you decide to participate in this research, you may stop participating at any time. If you decide not to participate in this study or if you stop participating at any time, you will not be penalized.\n\nIf you decide to stop taking part in the study, if you have questions, concerns, or complaints, or if you need to report an injury related to the research, please contact the investigator.",
