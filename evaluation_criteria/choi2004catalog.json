            "Bias in questionnaires is an important issue in public health research. To collect the most accurate data from respondents, investigators must understand and be able to prevent or at least minimize bias in the design of their questionnaires.",
            "This paper identifies and categorizes 48 types of bias in questionnaires based on a review of the literature and offers an example of each type. The types are categorized according to three main sources of bias: the way a question is designed, the way the questionnaire as a whole is designed, and how the questionnaire is administered.",
            "This paper is intended to help investigators in public health understand the mechanism and dynamics of problems in questionnaire design and to provide a checklist for identifying potential bias in a questionnaire before it is administered."

For the above question, it is inevitable that some respondents will put down a figure representing annual, not monthly, income. This question would be appropriate for a survey in Asia, however, since the culture there is to report monthly income. Pretesting the survey instrument should minimize this bias.",
